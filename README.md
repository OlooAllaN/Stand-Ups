Today my main focus was continue learning react. The concept of building independent components is a really powerful feature of react. Each component has different states and we can use those states to build rich powerful ui friendly application.

Today learned more about the presentation layer of web components. React has two library React and ReactDom. React library has function used for creating components and for making componets talk nicely together. ReactDom takes those components and renders them to the document object modal. React heavily centered on presenting content to users and reacting to user interaction with components. since the later version of JS are poorly supported with most browsers. We have to use a command line tool called babel to compile later version of Javascript into a suported of Js. React uses Es2016 so we have to make sure we includ our babel dependencies in order to compile React code into a friendly version of JS supported by most browsers.
